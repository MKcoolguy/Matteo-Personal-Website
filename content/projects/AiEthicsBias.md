Utilized statistical methods to determine the presence of a bias in a text classifier designed to detect toxicity in comments, categorizing them as 'toxic' or 'non-toxic'. This involved utilizing data analysis and statistical modeling to quantify potential biases. Specifically, calculating correlation coefficients among subgroups of protected classes against the text classifier's toxicity scores to assess any detected bias.
