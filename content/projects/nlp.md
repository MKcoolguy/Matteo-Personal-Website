Developed a low-level AI agent that can answer simple questions from simple sentences using classification, lexical analysis, and pragmatics. This agent relied on natural language processing without any external libraries, although spaCy was allowed to classify words in the given sentenced and questions as parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc..).
